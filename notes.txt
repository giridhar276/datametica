**** Everything in Python is OBJECT ****
**** Every object contains methods *****

number
-------
number can be integer or decimal or octal or hexa.

aval = 10
bval = 67.6


string  ( immutable , unchangable , read only)
------
string can be defined in single or double or triple quotes.
****** Characters inside the string cant be modified directly ****

aname = 'python programming'
bname = "scala programming"
cname = """java coding"""


list ( array in C )
-----
list contains set of elements.
Elements can be set of numbers or strings or any combination.
list elements are defined in [].

alist = [10,20,30]
blist = ["python","java"]
clist = [45,34.44,"java"]



tuple  ( read only , unchangable , immutable )
------
tuple contains set of elements.
Elements can be set of numbers or strings or any combination.
tuple elements are defined in ().
**** Elements inside tuple CANNOT be modified directly****

atup = (5,5,43,4)
btup = ("java","c","54",5,45.4)


dictionary
--------
dictionary contains elements in the form of keys:values 
In dictionary,
    keys are strings and numbers which are used to uniquely identify the value
    values can be number or string or list or tuple or dictionary or some complex datastructure.

syntax:   object = {key:value , key:value .... }
example:    book = {"chap1":10 ,"chap2":20,"chap3":30}
            info = {1:2,3:4,5:6}
            book = {"chap1":[10,"Rita","US"] ,"chap2":[20,"Gita","IND"] }


set
--------
set is UNORDERED collection of UNIQUE elements of SAME TYPE.

aset = {10,10,20,30}
